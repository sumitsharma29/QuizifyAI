# Implementation Plan - Phase 3 Premium Enhancements

The goal is to apply the final layer of "Ultra Premium" polish to the remaining pages and components.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This completes the UI overhaul by applying glassmorphism to Results, Profile, and Footer.

## Proposed Changes

### Components
#### [MODIFY] [Results.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sumit/OneDrive/Mini%20Project/QuizifyAI/src/pages/Results.jsx)
- **Container**: Replace standard white card with `.glass` utility.
- **Trophy Section**: Add a subtle animated background glow or confetti effect.
- **Score Cards**: Give them a translucent look.

#### [MODIFY] [Profile.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sumit/OneDrive/Mini%20Project/QuizifyAI/src/pages/Profile.jsx)
- **Header**: Enhance the user profile card with a better gradient backdrop.
- **Edit/Security Cards**: Convert to `.glass` containers.
- **History Grid**: Make history items pop more with hover effects.

#### [MODIFY] [Footer.jsx](file:///c:/Users/sumit/OneDrive/Mini%20Project/QuizifyAI/src/components/Footer.jsx)
- **Typography**: Ensure fonts match the new 'Outfit' family.
- **Links**: Add a slight "glow" on hover.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**:
  - Results page feels celebratory and high-end.
  - Profile looks clean and modern.
  - Footer integrates seamlessly with the dark mode/glass theme.
